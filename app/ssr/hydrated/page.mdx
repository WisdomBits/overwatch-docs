# Hydrated API

The `Hydrated` pattern in Overwatch ensures your app **waits for client-side hydration** of the server-passed snapshot before rendering your UI, preventing mismatches and ensuring **consistent SSR and CSR experiences**.

It wraps your app or parts of your tree, allowing you to safely use Overwatch shared state immediately after hydration.

---

## When to Use

- When using Overwatch with **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js**.
- To avoid UI flicker or hydration mismatches when accessing shared state.
- To ensure **state is fully hydrated before rendering your components**.
- To wrap layouts, pages, or specific parts of your app that require hydrated state.

---

## Example with Next.js

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
import Hydrated from './Hydrated'
import Counter from './Counter'

export default function Page({ snapshot }) {
  return (
    <Hydrated snapshot={snapshot}>
      <Counter /> // client component
    </Hydrated>
  )
}
```

In your `Counter` component:

```tsx
"use client"

import { useSharedState } from "overwatch-ts"

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useSharedState('counter')

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```

---

## How It Works

- `useHydratedStore(snapshot)` hydrates the client store with the server-passed snapshot.
- It returns `true` when hydration completes, triggering a re-render with the state ready.
- Until hydration is complete, your UI can render a skeleton or remain hidden to avoid mismatches.
