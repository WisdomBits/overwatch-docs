A minimal API with developer flexibility, TypeScript-first state-management solution, inspired by the simplicity of **Zustand**, It's a super lightweight yet expressive **state management library for React Js & Next Js**, built on the **singleton design pattern**. It offers support for **global and instance-specific middlewares**, **immutability**, **batched updates**, and **custom event communication** — all designed to be used without extensive boilerplate.

Goal with OverWatch was to prioritize reusability, a positive developer experience, and clear component-level state and event tracking.

*Stable Version - [![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/overwatch-ts?style=flat&colorA=000000&colorB=000000)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/overwatch-ts)*

> OverWatch evolved from an internal utility that leveraged the singleton and pub-sub patterns. We've now refined it for React, incorporating hooks, strong typing, and automatic cleanup to make it accessible to everyone.

## Use Overwatch in 3 Steps


### Installation

```bash
npm install overwatch-ts
````

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add overwatch-ts
```

---

### Step 1: createSharedState(key, initialValue)

This function initializes a shared state value globally. While **optional**, it's helpful for establishing a default state before any component mounts.

> If `createSharedState` isn't used, `useSharedState` will automatically create the key the first time it's accessed, providing a flexible starting point.

```ts
// Setting an initial theme
createSharedState('theme', { mode: 'dark' });
```
---

### Step 2: useSharedState(key)

> Use this hook in any component to **read** and **update** your shared state. It's your primary interface for interacting with OverWatch.

```ts
import { useSharedState } from 'overwatch-ts'; 

const ThemeSwitcher = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useSharedState<{ mode: string }>('theme');

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme({ mode: theme.mode === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark' });
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
      Switch to {theme.mode === 'dark' ? 'Light' : 'Dark'} Mode
    </button>
  );
};
```

---

### Step 3: usePicker(key, selectorFn)

> This hook allows you to extract only a specific part of a shared state object, which can help optimize component rendering by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

```ts
import { usePicker } from 'overwatch-ts'; 

const ThemeIndicator = () => {
  const mode = usePicker('theme', t => t.mode);

  return <div>{mode === 'dark' ? '🌑' : '☀️'}</div>;
};
```
**Why and when to use?**

* It helps prevent unnecessary re-renders, improving application performance.
* It's particularly useful for larger state objects where you only need to react to changes in one specific field.
