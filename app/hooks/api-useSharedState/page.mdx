# useSharedState

The `useSharedState` hook is the heart of Overwatch. It allows you to **read** and **update** your shared **singleton**, globally accessible state with **Reactivity**, **Immutability**, and **Middleware Support** out of the box.

---

## When to Use

-  Use this hook in any component to **read** and **update** your shared state across components or routes.
- You want to share state across components or routes
- You want to enforce immutability while retaining flexibility
- You want middleware execution for logging, analytics, etc.
- You want to use middleware specific to components.

---

## Syntax

```ts
const [theme, setTheme] = useSharedState(initializer, options?);
````

> initializer (name of the state created using createSharedState or batchCreateSharedStates)


## Example: Basic Counter

```ts
const [count, setCounter] = useSharedState('counter')
return <button onClick={() => setCounter(count+1)}>Count: {count}</button>
```

## Parameters

| Name          | Type                            | Description                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| initializer | name of the state | State created using createSharedState or batchCreateSharedStates
| options     | `middleware?`           | Optional.  Array of scoped middlewares |  
| options     | `store?`           | Optional. overiding the existing store should be of type store.                    |


## Scoped Middleware

Middleware provided through useSharedState runs only in that specific component instance â€” allowing per-component logic such as logging or access control.
```ts
const logger = (val, next) => {
      console.log("Only runs in THIS component:", val);
      next(val);
}
useSharedState('counter', {
  middleware: [logger]
});
```
> Middleware functions are called before the state updates. You can pass multiple middlewares, they'll be composed in order.
