# usePicker

The `usePicker` hook allows you to **subscribe to a specific slice of shared state**, reducing unnecessary re-renders by listening only to changes in the parts you care about.

It is the **Overwatch equivalent of `useSelector` in Redux**, designed for **precision reactivity and performance** in React and Next.js apps.

---

## When to Use

- You need to **get only a specific key of your shared state**.
- You want to **minimize re-renders** and optimize your components.
- You are building lists, dashboards, or heavy UI trees where only partial state changes should trigger updates.

## Syntax

```ts
const selected = usePicker<T, S>(
  key,
  selector,
  equalityFn?, 
  options?
)
````

## Parameters

| Parameter       | Type                      | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| key           | `string`                  | The key of the shared state created with `createSharedState` or `batchCreateSharedStates`.                                                      |
| selector      | `(state: T) => S`         | Function to select a part of the state you want to subscribe to.                                                                                |
| equalityFn    | `(a: S, b: S) => boolean` | Optional. Comparison function to determine equality and skip updates if the selected state hasn't changed. Defaults to strict equality (`===`). |
| options.store | `ServerStore`             | Optional. Used for SSR or custom stores.                                                                                                        |

## Example: Picking Specific State

Suppose you have a global `user` state:

```ts
createSharedState({
  name: 'Karan',
  age: 25,
  email: 'Karandeepsingh@overwatch.info'
}))
```

To subscribe **only to the user's name**:

```ts
const userName = usePicker('user', (state) => state.name)
```

Your component will now **only re-render when `state.name` changes**.

---

## Example with Custom Equality Function

If you want to subscribe to a nested object or use a custom comparison:

```ts
const userProfile = usePicker(
  'user',
  (state) => ({ name: state.name, email: state.email }),
  (a, b) => a.name === b.name && a.email === b.email
)
```

---

## Advanced: Using with SSR

If you are using Overwatch with SSR and `ServerStore`, you can pass your store explicitly:

```ts
const selected = usePicker('user', selectorFn, comparisionFn?, { store: serverStore })
```

---

## Internal Implementation (How it Works)

* **Uses React state** to hold the selected slice of your shared state.
* Subscribes to the shared state using Overwatchâ€™s `pubsub`.
* Uses `equalityFn` to determine if the selected value has changed before triggering a re-render.
