# useBroadcast

The `useBroadcast` hook allows your React components to **emit custom events** within your application using Overwatch’s **lightweight pub-sub system**.

It pairs seamlessly with [`useEvent`](/hooks/use-event) for **clean, decoupled, event-driven architecture** across your React and Next.js apps.

---

## When to Use

- You want to **trigger custom events** from a component or module.
- You need **component-to-component communication** without prop drilling.
- You are building workflows like notifications, keyboard shortcuts, or transient event flows.
- You want **clean, testable, decoupled logic** for emitting events.

---

## Syntax

```ts
const broadcast = useBroadcast<T>(eventName: string)
````

---

## Parameters

| Parameter   | Type     | Description                        |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| eventName | `string` | The key/name of the event to emit. |

---

## Example: Basic Usage

In one component:

```ts
const broadcastNotification = useBroadcast<{ message: string }>('notification')

const handleClick = () => {
  broadcastNotification({ message: 'New Notification' })
}
```

In another component:

```ts
useEvent<{ message: string }>('notification', (payload) => {
  console.log(payload.message) // "New Notification"
})
```

---

## Example: Triggering Events on User Actions

```ts
const broadcastShortcut = useBroadcast<string>('keydown')

const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
  broadcastShortcut(e.key)
}

useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown)
  return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown)
}, [])
```

In another component:

```ts
useEvent('keydown', (key) => {
  if (key === 'Escape') {
    closeModal()
  }
})
```

---

## Why useBroadcast?

- Decouples component communication
- Lightweight and minimal
- Pairs with `useEvent` seamlessly
- Useful for advanced workflows like command palettes or ephemeral event handling

---

## How It Works

* Creates a stable `broadcast` function scoped to your `eventName`.
* Uses Overwatch’s internal `pubsub` system to notify all `useEvent` subscribers when called.
* Events are handled instantly and efficiently.
