# Middleware

Overwatch supports **middleware** to enhance your state management with:

- Server Calls
- Logging  
- Analytics  
- Validation  
- Debugging

Middleware allows you to **intercept and control state updates** cleanly while maintaining Overwatch’s lightweight, boilerplate-free experience.

---

## Types of Middleware

Overwatch supports:

- **Global Middleware** – Applies to updates on a specific key globally.  
- **Local Middleware** – Applies to specific `useSharedState` instances locally within components.

---

## ① Global Middleware

### When to Use
- Track updates globally for a specific key.
- Enforce validation rules on specific state keys.
- Add analytics tracking or logging for a key across the app.

---

#### Example: Global Logger

```ts
const logger = (value, next) => {
  console.log("[Global Middleware]", value);
  next(value);
};

applyMiddleware("counter", logger);
```

> Now, **any update to the `counter` state** will pass through the logger, regardless of which component triggers it.

---

## ② Local Middleware

### When to Use

* Debug or transform updates in a **specific component**.
* Apply **validation or logging locally** without affecting other parts of the app.
* Enforce rules or behaviors for a single instance of state usage.

---

### Usage with useSharedState

Local middleware is handled directly within `useSharedState`:

```ts
const localLogger = (value, next) => {
  console.log("[Local Middleware]", value);
  next(value);
};

const [count, setCount] = useSharedState("counter", {
  middleware: [localLogger]
});
```

> Only **this component’s updates to `counter`** will pass through `localLogger`, ensuring scoped debugging or transformations.

---

## Middleware Signature Recap

### Global Middleware

```ts
(value: T, next: (v: T) => void) => void
```

* `value`: The new value being set.
* `next(value)`: Pass control to the next middleware or finalize the update.

---

### Local Middleware

Same as global:

```ts
(value: T, next: (v: T) => void) => void
```
